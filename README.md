# Arcana Mod

Arcana is a mod for **Minecraft 1.21.1**, developed using **Java 21** and **NeoForge**.  
This project is currently **in development**, and many systems, mechanics and story elements are actively evolving.

Arcana is not simply about adding new content. It is about atmosphere, mystery, choice, and consequence.  
If you open the book, you choose to deal with whatever comes after.

## Lore

An ancient mage named **Kaliastrus Novarcanus** bound his legacy inside a cursed diary.  
This book can be found inside special structures that appear on plains, close to the player.

Inside the diary, you will discover powerful rituals capable of summoning bosses in a fixed sequence.  
Each boss must be defeated in order, because every ritual requires an item dropped by the previous one.

When each boss is summoned, it speaks to the player — taunting, warning, or mocking — right before the battle begins.  
Defeating them grants permanent effects and powers, marking those who survive with traces of forbidden magic.
